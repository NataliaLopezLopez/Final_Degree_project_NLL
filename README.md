# Final_Degree_project_NLL
This repository contains the scripts I used during my Final Degree Project in Bioinformatics. The project focuses on EEG signal analysis to compare brain states (eyes open vs. closed) using metrics like Permutation Entropy, Skewness, and Kurtosis. It includes preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualizations.
